# Furniture eCommerce Website

This is a personal project I worked on individually to practice and reinforce my learning in ASP.NET Core Web API. The main goal was to build an eCommerce website where users can browse and purchase furniture.

## Project Overview

The project uses ASP.NET Core Web API for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. It simulates a simple eCommerce experience, focusing on key web development techniques, particularly API integration.

### Features

- **User Authentication & Authorization**: 
  - Implemented authentication and authorization mechanisms using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
  - Passwords are securely stored in hash format to ensure user data protection.
  
- **API Integration**: 
  - JavaScript is used on the frontend to fetch data from the ASP.NET Core Web API.
  - Users can interact with the API to view product listings, add items to the cart, and place orders.

### Technologies Used

- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core Web API
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Token)
- **Password Storage**: Hash format for secure password management

### Key Learning Points

- Setting up and working with ASP.NET Core Web API.
- Managing authentication and authorization in a secure way using JWT.
- Fetching and displaying data from an API using JavaScript.
- Password hashing for added security.
